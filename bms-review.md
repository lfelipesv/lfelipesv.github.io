#### Managing science beyond research papers

In the last week of June I attended the course "The Business of Managing Science: Entrepreneurial and Organizational skills for professionals working in life sciences" (BMS) organized by Institut Pasteur Korea (IPK). As a scientist that recently transitioned to research in bioinformatics and computational biology working in a project related to applying AI methods to drug discovery, when my CI sent the advertisement poster of the course, that was posted in our institute's website, two words actually brought my attention: "business" and "life sciences". Even I had some previous experience developing software that transitioned from academy to industry, coming from a pure academic background (BSc, MSc, and PhD) the words "business" and "entrepeneurship" were not something that really interested me. However, given that the course was intented to "professionals working in life sciences" I thought the course would be a good opportunity to understand more about the field and to do some networking with other researchers. In the end, the course turned out being really interesting and covered various aspects that have been lacking from my scientist background. In this small essay I will try to summarize my overall experience while attending the course in loco at IPK.

The course curriculum covered topics such as Entrepreneurship, Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property and Science Management (R). The lecturers were specialists with long experience in this area working dealing directly with startups in the life sciences for the last 20 years at the Institut Pasteur in France and Iran. The students had various backgrounds, coming from the life sciences, computer science, finance, and science and development management. Even being topics that are usually dense to be delivered to a diverse audience, e.g. Intellectual Property and Patents, the lectures were engaging and healthy discussions with between lecturers and students paved the way during the entire course.

For me, especially, the biggest lesson came during the lectures regarding Technology Transfer and Maturation. In a moment, when a slide with the diagram with the entire process of transforming an idea into a product was being displayed (Idea → Discovery → Invention → Application → First Application → Building up Product/Offer) suddenly the term "managing science" from the course title came back to my mind and it opened my eyes to the complexity of science beyond research papers. Having an idea that leads to novel knowledge, innovation and a final product that can impact the life of millions of people is a long process with risk involved in all the steps. Coming from a software background where the timeline from an idea to a product is much shorter when compared to the life sciences in which the timeline of the discovery of a new drug can take decades, e.g. the process of development of a vaccine usually takes 12 years, I feel that understanding the importance of a well done maturation process of an idea during the development of prototypes and investigating the transfer into a product would benefit a lot the current technology market. It was also presented an interesting of de-risking that is developed at the Institut Pasteur Paris that alleaviate the pressure for entrepreneurs during the maturation process, which lead to more robust products from these startups when they reach the market.

Another interesting part of the course was that the lectures usually were interleaved with talks (flagship faculty lectures) by CEOs of biotech startups or university professors that closely collaborate with IPK. These talks brought an opportunity to learn a lot of insights from the CEO perspectives regarding the current biotech market and products, their successes and failures, and understanding the management of finances by startups considering their stage and investment history. Regarding the biotech market it was interesting to see the recent success cases while developing antibody therapeutics, an area that is currently close to my research in drug discovery. About success and failure experiences, during the talks, the CEOs were really opened about sharing their life background and not only sharing their success experiences but a lot of the challenges and failures along the way, such as launching startups that failed along the way. Finally, in a market in which the timeline to launch a new product takes years (if passing through all the early drug discovery process and clinical trials), it was possible to observe the importance of having an import financial plan to not spend all the investment money in the middle of the development process without a plan B or being dependent on a successful new round of investments. It is a difficult reality of this market, but in the first years of these startups they are not profitable. Also, a high risk is involved as they are dependent on the successful development of a new drug that, then, can lead to partnerships with big pharmaceutical companies for big contracts. 

With the end of the lectures and talks, we (students) had the final challenge to prepare a presentation (in one night) with a business/market plan for a new product or service to present to our lecturers. Despite of the short preparation time, the presentations had great quality and creativity with topics that ranged from new biotech products, new software-based biotech services, diagnostic kits, and, even, career plans. After the presentation, the panel with the lecturers would ask questions like it if was a serious project pitch that would select startups for an incubation program. This round of questions was one of the moments that I felt like learning more during the course. The questions and advices from the lecturers were always really insightful (they could grasp our business plans deeply identifying strenghnessess and weaknessess) coming from years of experience of observing startups that succeeded and failed. To have this kind of feedback and expertise on the entire process of going from research in  fundamental science to tranferring a discovery into a product that reach the market might be one of the crucial points for the high success rate of the startups launched at Institut Pasteur in the recent years.

To conclude this essay, I would like to reinforce that it was a great opportunity to attend the BMS course. I learned from great lecturers, visited state-of-the-art IPK facilities, and met amazing people. Most importantly, I feel that the curriculum delivered in the course, especially the one related to managing science, is very important and can be very helpful to young scientists that like me have a lack of understanding in subjects like technology transfer and intellectual property management strategies. Even with the recent addition of business, social science and economics classes to different technology-related academic curriculum, it is still crucial to deliver effectively how and why we develop science that can generate knowledge, new discoveries and innovation in a way that this knowledge leads to positive impact in the future of our society.
