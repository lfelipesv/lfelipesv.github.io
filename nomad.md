#### Nomad

In this page, my plan is to share some pictures I took while traveling and were lost in my external hard drive. 

They contain beautiful sceneries and bring me good memories and thoughts that I want to share with each picture.

### Rio de Janeiro - Brazil

Do leme ao pontal, nao ha nada igual no mundo."

### Sao Joao del Rey - Brazil

"Anda, vem jantar, vem dormir, vem sonhar, pra viver ate chegar em Lumiar  
estender o sol na varanda ate queimar... so pra nao ter mais nada a perder  
pra perder o medo, mudar de ceu, mudar de ar, clarear de vez, Lumiar..."  
(Lumiar - Beto Guedes)

### Mount Snow - Vermont - USA

### New York - USA

"It is my own desire, it is my own remorse  
Help me to decide, help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure  
Nothing ever lasts forever, everybody wants to rule the world"

### Brasilia - Brazil

"Hold on, it is never enough  
It is never enough until your heart stops beating  
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain  
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating"    
(Shellshock - New Order)

### Daecheon Beach - South Korea

Nice to see you again  
I know you stole the sun  
But i hope you came to show"
