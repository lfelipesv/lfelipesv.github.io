### Bio

I am currently a **Senior Researcher** at the **Data Science Group, Institute for Basic Science, South Korea**.  

My research aims to develop **Generative AI** methods for **basic science** applications, especially drug discovery (protein and antibody design) and climate change. For this, I am particularly interested in developing novel **reinforcement learning** (RL) algorithms, **graph neural networks** (GNNs), and **diffusion-based** models. Currently, I am working towards Generative AI for protein and antibody design applied to drug discovery in the following topics:

- **Generative AI for Protein/Antibody Design**: protein sequence design via RL, antigen-conditioned antibody design using geometric deep learning, graph neural networks and diffusion models.
- **Protein Foundation Models that uses both 1D sequence and 3D structure information**: development algorithms and training protein foundation models that incorporate 1D and 3D (multimodal) information.
- **AI-based methods for Protein/Antibody Design**: training of antibody-specific models for structure prediction, inverse folding, and error prediction.

My general interests include artificial intelligence, deep reinforcement learning, and applied deep learning. From these, I am particularly interested in:

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: improving sampling efficiency and performance by developing new credit assignment and exploration methods, goal-conditioned RL, graph structure refinement via RL. 
- **Graph Neural Networks**: development of novel algorithms to be applied to target-conditioned protein design, applying GNNs to error prediction.
- **Diffusion Models**: application of diffusion-based models for 3D structure generation, development of diffusion algorithms for 3D full atom protein structure generation.  

I have previous research experiences in Deep Reinforcement Learning applied to **Robotics** (continuous control, development of simulated environments, multi-agent systems), **Speech Synthesis** (corpus building and segmentation, statistical parametric speech synthesis), and **Natural Language Processing** (using sequence-to-sequence models combined with LSTMs and Transformers).  

My personal interests include traveling, sports (football, kickboxing, skate, snowboard, surf, surfskate), music (classical guitar, cavaquinho) and reading (fantasy, science fiction, mountaineering).
