#### Bio

I am currently a Post-doc researcher at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea. My current research involves Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. I have previous research experiences in Speech Synthesis (corpus building and segmentation, statistical parametric speech synthesis, speaker adaptation) and Natural Language Processing (using recurrent neural networks). My personal interests include traveling, sports, music (classical guitar, cavaquinho) and reading.
