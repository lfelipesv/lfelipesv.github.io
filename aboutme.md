#### Bio

I am currently a **Senior Researcher** at the **Data Science Group, Institute for Basic Science, South Korea**.  
My main research goal is to **develop** and **apply** deep learning methods for science understanding. In the **development** of novel deep learning methods I am particular interested in **Deep Reinforcement Learning** and **Graph Neural Networks**. My research in **Deep Reinforcement Learning** involves improving sampling efficiency and performing by developing new credit assignment and exploration methods. My research in **Graph Neural Networks** involves the development of methods that can be applied to Protein and Antibody design in drug discovery.  
I have previous research experiences in Deep Reinforcement Learning applied to **Robotics** (continuous control, development of simulated environments, multi-agent systems), **Speech Synthesis** (corpus building and segmentation, statistical parametric speech synthesis), and **Natural Language Processing** (using sequence-to-sequence models combined with LSTMs and Transformers).  
My personal interests include traveling, sports (football, kickboxing, skate, surfskate), music (classical guitar, cavaquinho) and reading (fantasy, science fiction, mountaineering).
