#### Bio

I am currently a Senior Researcher at the Data Science Group, Institute for Basic Science, South Korea. My current research involves Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Bioinformatics. I have previous research experiences in Deep Reinforcement Learning applied to Robotics (continuous control, development of simulated environments), Speech Synthesis (corpus building and segmentation, statistical parametric speech synthesis), and Natural Language Processing (using recurrent neural networks). My personal interests include traveling, sports, music (classical guitar, cavaquinho) and reading.
