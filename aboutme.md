### Bio

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the **Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP), Bochum, Germany**.  

My research aims to develop flexible **artificial intelligence** algorithms that can be applied with different data modalities in multi-agent scenarios. These include novel **reinforcement learning** (RL) algorithms, **graph neural networks** (GNNs), and **diffusion-based** models. My general interests include artificial intelligence, deep reinforcement learning, robotics, and applied deep learning. From these, I am particularly interested in:

- **Multi-Agent Systems**: development of multi-agent RL algorithms in collaborative and collaborative-competitive environments, modeling of multi-agent RL in a continual learning setting. 
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: improving sampling efficiency and performance by developing new credit assignment and exploration methods, goal-conditioned RL, graph structure refinement via RL. 
- **Foundation Models applied to Robotics**: investigation of the potential and risks of LLMs and foundation models for robotics.
- **Graph Neural Networks**: development of novel algorithms to be applied to target-conditioned generation, applying GNNs to error prediction.
- **Diffusion Models**: application of diffusion-based models for 3D structure generation, development of diffusion-based and flow matching-based algorithms for 3D structure prediction. 

Currently, I am also working towards **Generative AI for protein and antibody design** applied to drug discovery in the following topics:

- **Generative AI for Protein/Antibody Design**: protein sequence design via RL, antigen-conditioned antibody design using geometric deep learning, graph neural networks and diffusion models.
- **AI-based methods for Protein/Antibody Design**: training of antibody-specific models for structure prediction, inverse folding, and error prediction.

My previous research has been applied to diverse domains such as **Robotics** (continuous control, development of simulated environments, multi-agent systems), **Speech Synthesis** (corpus building and segmentation, statistical parametric speech synthesis), and **Natural Language Processing** (using sequence-to-sequence models combined with LSTMs and Transformers).  

My personal interests include traveling, sports (football, kickboxing, skate, snowboard, surf, surfskate), music (classical guitar, cavaquinho) and reading (fantasy, science fiction, mountaineering).
